# custom_commute_planner
Python 2.7 script for a beta version of a transit-based trip planner; incorporates a custom GUI via Tkinter. 

This was a demo project for a 2019 Programming for GIS class at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

See the attached Python code, and the PDF documentation which contains the background for the demo project.

Code written in Python 2.7 and relies on Google Directions API for results. 

NOTE: As of Feb 2021, the code will not print results properly due to changes in the JSON output. 

However, the custom GUI and API request process works as intended. Update TBD.
