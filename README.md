# custom_commute_planner
Demo Python 2.7 script for a beta version of a transit-based trip planner with custom GUI using Google Directions API. 

This is a demo project. Beta/personal use so expect some bugs.

----------------------------------------------------------------

REQUIRES: Google Directions API key.

HOW TO USE: Run the Python script. A custom GUI pops up to asks for inputs. Input Google Directions API key, start location, end location, desired arrival time, and output file name.

RESULTS: Produces a .txt file with details for multiple trip segments from start to end (see attached sample). 

----------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: As of Feb 2021, the code will not print results properly due to changes in the JSON output. 

However, the custom GUI and API request process works as intended. Update TBD.
