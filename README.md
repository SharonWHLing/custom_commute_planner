# custom_commute_planner
Demo Python 2.7 script for a beta version of a transit-based trip planner with custom GUI using Google Directions API. 

This was a demo project for a 2019 Programming for GIS class at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Beta/personal use so expect some bugs.

REQUIRES: Google Directions API key.

NOTE: As of Feb 2021, the code will not print results properly due to changes in the JSON output. 

However, the custom GUI and API request process works as intended. Update TBD.
